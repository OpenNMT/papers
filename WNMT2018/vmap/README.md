This directory contains tools for building and evaluating vocabulary mapping files (a.k.a. *vmap*). These files are used to dynamically reduce the size of the target vocabulary during translation.

# File format

A vocabulary map is a text file mapping source N-grams to a list of target tokens. Each line has the following format:

```text
source N-gram\tw_1 w_2 w_3 ... w_K
```

A source N-gram can be empty (0-gram).

Since we are only interested to predict the vocabulary of a full sentence, the words associated to a specific N-gram are not necessarily its actual translation, but they are words necessary to build the meaning of the N-gram.

# Vocabulary calculation

Given a sentence `S = m_1 ... m_k`, the target vocabulary `Tvoc` is calculated as followed:

```text
Tvoc.insert(vmap[''])

for i = 1, k do
  for p = 1, k-i+1 do
    seq = concat(m_p, ' ', ..., m_{p+i-1})
    Tvoc.insert(vmap[seq])
  end
 end
```

# Building a phrase table

Building a vmap requires a phrase table for your language pair. It can be generated using the provided Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t build-pt
docker run --rm -v MYCORPUSPATH:/root/corpus build-pt CORPUSNAME SS TT N > phrase-table.gz
```

where:

* `CORPUSPATH/CORPUSNAME.{SS,TT}` are tokenized source and target files
* `N` is the max N-gram length (3 is usually a good value)

# Building a vmap

The vmap can be generated with the `build-vmap.py` script:

```text
usage: build-vmap.py [-h] -pt PHRASE_TABLE [-zg ZERO_GENERATE_LIST]
                     [-ms MAX_SIZE] [-mf MIN_FREQ] [-km KEEP_MEANING]
                     [-tv TGT_VOCAB] [-l LIMIT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -pt PHRASE_TABLE, --phrase_table PHRASE_TABLE
                        phrase table
  -zg ZERO_GENERATE_LIST, --zero_generate_list ZERO_GENERATE_LIST
                        list of terms generated from 0
  -ms MAX_SIZE, --max_size MAX_SIZE
                        maximal size of source sequences
  -mf MIN_FREQ, --min_freq MIN_FREQ
                        minimal frequency of pair
  -km KEEP_MEANING, --keep_meaning KEEP_MEANING
                        number of meaning to keep per entry
  -tv TGT_VOCAB, --tgt_vocab TGT_VOCAB
                        save target vocabulary for max coverage calculation
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        limit the number of entries (for dev)
```

The vmap is generated on the standard output, and the 20 most common meanings are written on the error output.

These common meanings can be saved to a file and passed to the `-zg` option. They will be added in the vmap as tokens that are always considered for a translation. For example:

**Example:**

```bash
# Dry run to generate the 20 most common meanings:
python build-vmap.py -pt phrase-table.gz 1> /dev/null 2> zg.txt

# Build the vmap:
python build-vmap.py -pt phrase-table.gz -zg zg.txt 1> vmap.txt 2> /dev/null
```

# Evaluating the vmap

You can evaluate the coverage of a vmap on a given test set (tokenized source and target files) with the `eval-vmap.py` script and the `TGT_VOCAB` that was optionally generated by the `build-vmap.py` script.

```text
usage: eval-vmap.py [-h] -vmap VMAP [-tv TV] -src SRC -tgt TGT

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -vmap VMAP  a vocab mapping file
  -tv TV      target vocabulary file
  -src SRC    source file
  -tgt TGT    target file
```

The script outputs the coverage ratio of the target sentences predicted from source sentences according to the vmap, and the number of vocabs per sentence.
